# How to Update Your Invitation Website (No Coding Needed)

This guide shows exactly how to change the most common details.

   - `<p class="event-date">...`
   - `<p class="event-time">...`
   - `<p class="event-location">...`
3. Edit the text between `>` and `<`.
4. Save the file.

## 2) Update Google Maps Link
1. Search for `id="map"` in `index.html`.
2. Replace `https://maps.google.com` with your venue map URL.

## 3) Replace the Photo
1. Put your photo file in the `images/` folder named `birthday-girl.jpg`.
2. Keep the name the same so it loads automatically.

## 4) Add Your Google Form
1. Create your form at `forms.google.com`.
2. Click Send â†’ `<>` (Embed) â†’ Copy the iframe code.
3. In `index.html`, search for `iframe src="https://docs.google.com/forms`.

## 5) Change Colors or Fonts
- Open `css/style.css`.
